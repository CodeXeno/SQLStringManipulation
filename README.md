# SQLStringManipulation
Would like to optimize string manipulation on one of the columns
Not sure the manipulation is as efficient as it could be. This project is for a friend who has no ability to fix the issues with his database.
We have to resort to removing all the text, leaving only the amount associated to the credit card Maestro. We have to add the total of 
the CreditCard Column to this new column.
